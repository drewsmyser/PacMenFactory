# PacMenFactory
PacMen Exercise from MIT Professional Coding Class

The second PacMan activity from my MIT certificate course! This is a fun and interactive activity where you can generate many many PacMen and send them bouncing around the screen. 

It's very simple to use: simply utilize the buttons at the top of the activity to both generate PacMen and then start them in motion!

I look forward to improving this code and adding more images for the factory to pull from and images that change after bouncing off the wall.
